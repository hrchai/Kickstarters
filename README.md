# R Project: Kickstarter Campaigns 
Intending to assist start-up small businesses or individuals in achieving their fund-raising goals, I conducted research and undertook a systematic data analysis process. Using R and R Studio, I extracted, deep cleaned, and pre-processed large-scale Kickstarter campaign data. Employing advanced data mining algorithms of Neural Networks and Decision Tree, I developed predictive models based on the training (70%) data and tested their accuracy on the testing (30%) data. The resulting model showcases an impressive accuracy rate of over 80% in predicting the success probability of a Kickstarter campaign. This reliable and efficient tool holds significant potential for empowering aspiring entrepreneurs and individuals to make informed decisions and enhance their fundraising outcomes.
